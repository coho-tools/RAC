% Inveter models

ODE models
  We use  
    \dot{Vo} = -T*(Vsat*tanh(Vi/Vs) + Vo);
  to model an inveter circuit for the inveter-ring oscillator (also for rambus-ring oscillator).
  
  Parameters: 
    T is a constant (usually doesn't matter).
    Vsat is the max value of V. We set Vsat as one, so the IRO oscillates in the range of [-1,1].  
    Vs is the input load. When it is small, IRO oscillates faster, and the orbit is close to rectangle. 
    When Vs is large, it oscillates slower, or doesn't oscillate at all. The orbit shape is like cycle. 
    Vsat decide the magnitude, Vsat/Vs decides the shape, >1.5 to make IRO oscillates.
    For N = 3, the magnitude of orbit is not Vsat, only Vsat/2, why? 

LDI models
  The IRO models is:
    Xl = Eprev * X; Eprev(i,i-1)=1;
    \dot(X)= -T*(X+Vsat*tanh(Xl/Vs) 
           = -T*X -T*Vsat*tanh(Xl/Vs)
           = -T*X -T*Vsat*Eprev*tanh(X/Vs)
  
  So need to linearize:
    f(x)   = tanh(x) 
           = tanh(x0) + sechx0^2 *dx +/- err 
           = sechx0^2 * x + tanh(x0) - sechx0^2*x0 +/- err
    dx \in [-C,C]
    err    = tanh(x) - tanh(x0) - sech(x0)^2*dx 
           = (tanh(x0)+tanh(dx))/(1+tanh(x0)*tanh(dx))-tanh(x0) - sech(x0)^2*dx
           = tanh(dx)*(1-tanh(x0)^2)/(1+tanh(x0)*tanh(dx)) - sech(x0)^2*dx
           = tanh(dx)*sech(x0)^2/(1+tanh(x0)*tanh(dx)) - sech(x0)^2*dx
           = sech(x0)^2* (tanh(dx)/(1+tanh(x0)*tanh(dx)) - dx)
  
  Now compute the min/max value of err
    let a  = tanh(x0)
    g(x)   = tanh(x)/(1+a*tanh(x)) -x
           = 1/a - 1/(a*(1+a*tanh(x))) - x 
    let dg(x) = 0, get 
         x = atanh(-2*a/(1+a^2))
  So the max value of 'err' could be on x = [-C,C,atanh(-2*a/(1+a^2))] 
      (last point only if in range)
